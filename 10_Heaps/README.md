# **Heaps**
- specialized complete binary tree
- keys must satisfy they *heap property* 
    - key at each node is at least as great as they keys stored w/in children
- Use Heap when all you care about is the largest or smallest elements
    - don't need to support fast lookup for other elements 
    - just max/min
- Good for computing k largest/smallest elements in a collection
